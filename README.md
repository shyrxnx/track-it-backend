# Track-It Backend

**Track-It Backend** is the server-side application that powers the **Track-It** habit tracker, providing RESTful API endpoints for managing user habits and tracking their progress.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** (LTS version recommended)
- **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)** (optional, but recommended for cloning the repository)

To check if Node.js and npm are installed, run:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

## 📦 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the backend project up and running on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the repository

First, clone the project to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shyrxnx/track-it-backend.git
cd track-it-backend
```

### 2. Install the dependencies

Once you have cloned the repository, run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the development server

After the dependencies are installed, you can run the backend locally with:

```bash
node server.js
```

This will start the server on port 5000 by default. You should see a message like:

```
Server is running on port 5000
```

You can now interact with the API via `http://localhost:5000/`.
